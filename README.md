# Mod5_Pyber_Analysis

# An Analysis of PyBer Rideshare Data
## Overview of the Project

The goal of this module is to perform an analysis of data for a ridesharing app company that will help the decision-makers at the company improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordabiltiy for underserved neighborhoods. To do this, the challenge asked for a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph with the weekly fares for each city by type--to clearly demonstrate how urban, suburban, and rural rideshares differ. 

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.9, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.7, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.1

## Results
Urban cities have approximately 2.6 times and 13 times as many total rides than suburban and rural cities, respectively. Urban cities also have nearly 5 times as many drivers as suburban cities and nearly 31 times as many driveres as rural cities.

Total fares collected for this data set, which spans from January-May 2019 is $63,538.64. Rural cities make up just 6.8% of total fares collected, while suburban and urban cities make up 30.5% and 62.7%, respectively.

Average fares per ride are higher in rural areas, with rural rides costing approximately 10.5% more than suburban cities and 29.1% more than urban cities.

Average fares per driver are lower in urban areas. Urban fares are 58% cheaper than suburban fares and 70% cheaper than rural fares.

This line chart shows that urban cities had the highest total fares for each week, while suburban cities had the second-highest total fares, and rural cities had the lowest total fares for each week between January and April. The drop in total fares for urban and suburban city types during the beginning of April may need additional analysis in order to determine the sudden decrease in total fares.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type

## Summary
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

It is recommended PyBer conduct this analysis with rider demographics, such as poplution, age range, and gender, as this could impact analysis. PyBer would also benefit from conducting this analysis periodically in order to determine if more or less drivers are needed in a particular area. Additionally, times of day, holidays, weather, and community events could also impact PyBer's trend and pattern analysis.
