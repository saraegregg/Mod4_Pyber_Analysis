# An Analysis of PyBer Rideshare Data
## Overview of the Project

The goal of this module is to perform an analysis of data for a ridesharing app company, "PyBer", that will help the decision-makers at the company improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To do this, the challenge asked for a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and a multiple-line graph with the weekly fares for each city by type--to clearly demonstrate how urban, suburban, and rural rideshares differ. 

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Python 3.9.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

## Results

**Ridesharing Data Summary:** 
![deliverable_1](https://github.com/saraegregg/Mod5_Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/images/deliverable_1.png)

Urban cities have approximately 2.5 and 13 times as many total rides than suburban and rural cities, respectively. Urban cities also have nearly 5 times as many drivers as suburban cities and nearly 31 times as rural cities.

Total fares collected for this data set, which spans from January through May 2019, is $63,538.64. Rural cities make up just 6.8% of total fares collected, while suburban and urban cities make up 30.5% and 62.7%, respectively.

Average fares per ride are higher in rural areas, with rural rides costing approximately 10.5% more than suburban cities and 29.1% more than urban cities.

Average fares per driver are lower in urban areas. Urban fares are 58% cheaper than suburban fares and 70% cheaper than rural fares.

**Total Weekly Fare by City Type**

This line chart demonstrates how urban cities had the highest total fares every week by a considerable margin. Similarly suburban cities had the second-highest total fares with a wide margin over rural cities, which had the lowest total fares from January through April of 2019. 


## Summary
I would recommend considering ways to reduce the average fare in rural and suburban areas, such as recruiting more drivers, to increase the affordability of each trip. I believe that this would consequently increase the total number of trips in these two city types. I also recommend that PyBer conduct further analysis including rider demographics, such as rider age range and gender, to discover if there is a relationship between these factors and the city types reviewed in this analysis. It would be beneficial to conduct this analysis periodically to determine if the data continues to support these recommendations in the future.
